This code provides a GUI for our HW2 wordle implementaton.  The GUI allows users to play the game in a more user-friendly way,
with visual feedback and a interface that allows for more intuitive interaction. When run, it will launch a graphical interface for the game. The user 
can then input their guesses using the text fields provided, and the program will update the grid to show which letters are correct and incorrect. It will
aslo inform the user if they inputed an ivalid guess. When the game ends, it will allow them to play again or exit the game.
